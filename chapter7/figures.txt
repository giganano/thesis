2. Distributions in age, [O/H], and [Fe/H] binned by radius.

3. Measurements of the median age and mode([X/H]) radial gradients.

4. Annuli diagram

5. Familiarize the reader with \eta = 0 versus \eta \propto e^R: present the
	SFHs of the inside-out model from Johnson++21 and a simple exponential with
	e-folding timescales calibrated to predict mode([O/H]) as a function of
	radius.

6. Familiarize the reader with \eta = 0 versus \eta \propto e^R: gas-phase
	gradients, MDFs, and [O/H] versus time at a selection of radii for a simple
	exponential SFH under both scenarios.

	- Uses analytic mode calculations to determine \tau_sfh for the \eta = 0
		scenario.
		Associated discussion of why the mode is a useful summary statistic of
		choice for comparing models and data.

	- Take the fiducial inside-out model from Johnson++21.
		Note that solving for \tau_sfh given the observed age gradient is an
		attractive option, though due to the young median ages across a broad
		range of radii, there is no solution in the \tau_sfh > 0 regime.
		This is a limitation of this SFH parameterization that we return to
		in discussion of the final figure.
		Though the M19 age catalog is known to have a dearth of old stars (>10
		Gyr), which could bias our age gradient results, the rise-fall SFH has
		the most difficulty predicting young ages (e.g., ~2-3 Gyr as in the
		outer disk), which are present in the catalog anyway.
		APOGEE selection function also the principle unknown uncertainty.

	- Can demonstrate that stellar migration has minimal impact on the summary
		statistics of our models in either case.

7. Solve for \tau_sfh and \tau_rise given the observed gas-phase gradient in
	the Galaxy assuming \eta = 0, plot median age versus radius for different
	parameter choices.

8. For fiducial parameter choice from previous figure, plot stellar gradient
	binned by age and overlay present-day gas-phase gradient as black dotted
	line.

9. Take the same model and apply a v_g = -1 km/s inward radial flow. Show the
	same figure but for the \eta = 0 and \eta \propto e^R scenario from J+21.

10. [O/H] versus time at a selection of radii from both models in the prevous
	figure.

	\dot{Z}_{O,flow} as a function of time in both the \eta = 0 and \eta \propto
	e^R scenario, demonstrating that flows are indeed a runaway sink in the
	absence of mass-loaded outflows.

	\mu_flow for oxygen as a function of time in these two cases as well.

11. mode of [O/H], [Fe/H], or both as a function of radius for flow velocities
	of 0, -1, -2, and -3 km/s, demonstrating that in the presence of
	mass-loading that grows with radius, the effect of a radial flow is to
	lower the metallicity globally and flatten the gradient if the flow is
	directed inward and the abundance gradient declines monotonically.

12. Measurements of mode([X/H]) gradients conditioned on stellar age.

13. slope of [O/H] and [Fe/H] as a function of age.

14. [O/H] gradients at various snapshots for outerburst SFH (locus of burst
	shifted to ~5 Gyr ago as suggested by Fig. 13) with \eta \propto
	e^R, a two-infall model with \eta \propto e^R, and a two-infall model with
	\eta = 0, each with a -1 km/s inward gas flow.

	Explore parameter variations.


!!!
10. For the fiducial parameter choice from the previous figure, plot the
	gradient binned by age to demonstrate that this model does not predict
	a steady normalization in the stellar gradient.

	- For this parameterization of the SFH, the normalization of the gradient
		grows with time, which is not observed.
		Furthermore, the gas-phase gradient has a much higher normalization
		than the stellar gradient, also not observed.
		Saw the same thing with the pure exponential SFH in previous figure.
		Expect result to be generic, because in any system in which an
		equilibrium exists, the tendency will always be toward that equilibrium
		state.

	\eta \propto e^R and apply a -1 km/s inward gas flow.
	Show gradients conditioned on age and the age-metallicity relation in the
	solar annulus for both models.

	- Demonstrate effect of "reverse evolution" in the \eta = 0 scenario.
		Associated discussion of why radial gas flows are a runaway sink under
		this parameterization and the analytic motivation for why we expect
		the result to be generic.

12. \dot{Z}_{x,flow} and [O/H] as functions of time at a selection of radii
	from Fig. 10.
	Hit the reader over the head with the idea that when \eta = 0 models are
	confronted with radial gas flows, the ensuing reverse evolution has
	considerably strong effects that are not observed.


13. \mu_flow and its components for an inside-out SFH and \eta = 0 model both
	with flow velocities of -1 km/s.


13. mode of [O/H], [Fe/H], or both as a function of radius for flow velocities
	of 0, -1, -2, and -3 km/s, demonstrating that in the presence of
	mass-loading that grows with radius, the effect of a radial flow is to
	lower the metallicity globally and flatten the gradient if the flow is
	directed inward and the abundance gradient declines monotonically.

14. Gradients binned by age for the inside-out SFH, the lateburst SFH, and a
	realization of the two-infall model, both with \eta \propto e^R, stellar
	migration, and a -1 km/s inward gas flow.

	- With \eta \propto e^R, one can get essentially any gradient they want by
		specifying the scale radius of the exponential profile, and the details
		of the SFH become a small effect. This lines up with the simulation
		result that we should expect a diversity of SFHs in MW-like galaxies
		and the observational result that there is not a wide range of
		diversity in abundance gradients. We expect the qualitative results of
		the two-infall model to hold when extended to the \eta \propto e^R
		scenario, but quantitatively, the timescales and relative amplitudes of
		the two infall episodes as well as the delay between them will likely
		need revised.

	- The shape of the Galactic SFH remains one of the largest systematic
		uncertainties in pinning down the origin and evolution of the radial
		abundance gradient.
		In particular, the young ages at large radii are difficult to explain
		unless there was recent star formation at these radii, which could
		potentially be explained by the recent starburst model?

	- Does the lateburst model fix the ages of stars? Does it explain the
		marginal upward evolution in abundances in the outer disk over the past
		~6 Gyr? Or does the relative constancy of the gradient with time place
		relatively strict limits on the variability in the Galactic SFH? Is the
		timescale of the lateburst model simply too recent to explain this
		observe result? Does it indicate a longer timescale, and that the
		outerburst model may be more accurate? In the case of the latter, best
		to swap out the lateburst model for the outerburst model in the figure
		if this turns out to be the case.


!!! Double check that the \eta = 0 models with radial flows still produce
	realistic surface density gradients in both gas and stars.
