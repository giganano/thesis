1. Kiel diagram of our sample

2. Distributions in age, [O/H], and [Fe/H] binned by radius.

3. Measurements of the median age and mode([X/H]) radial gradients.

4. Measurements of mode([X/H]) radial gradients conditioned on stellar age.

5. \mu_flow, \gamma_flow as a function of radius.

6. Median age as a function of radius predicted by solving for \tau_sfh and
	\tau_rise given different parameter choices.

7. Gradient binned by age for a model that does not reach equilibrium within
	the disk lifetime.

8. Gradients binned by age for a model with \eta = 0 alongside a model where
	\eta \propto e^R, each with and without radial flows.
