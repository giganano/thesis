2. Distributions in age, [O/H], and [Fe/H] binned by radius.

3. Measurements of the median age and mode([X/H]) radial gradients.

4. Measurements of mode([X/H]) radial gradients conditioned on stellar age.

5. \mu_flow, \gamma_flow as a function of radius.

6. Median age as a function of radius predicted by solving for \tau_sfh and
	\tau_rise given different parameter choices.

	- If \eta = 0 everywhere, and we know the present-day composition of the
		ISM as a function of radius, then we can solve directly for \tau_sfh
		and \tau_rise as a function of radius.
		From this we can predict the intrinsic age gradient directly.
		More generally, without mass loading or radial gas flows, the only
		thing that can produce variations in Z as a function of radius is the
		shape of the SFH, which gives one a direct mapping between the
		abundance gradient and the age gradient.
		Within this framework, the observed abundance gradient predicts summary
		statistics of ages that are too young compared to the data and do not
		satisfy the result that the disk is in chemical equilibrium.


7. Gradient binned by age for the fiducial model from the previous figure.

	- A disk which is not in chemical equilibrium, such as the one presented
		previously, predicts an upward evolution of the normalization of the
		gradient with time.
		This fails due to two observables: first, this is detectable in the
		gradient binned by age, and second, this model predicts a present-day
		gas-phase gradient whose normalization is considerably higher than the
		stellar gradient, which is not observed.
		We expect this result to be generic as in any system which is
		significantly far from equilibrium, the tendency with time will always
		be toward equilibrium; we have also explored other parameterizations of
		the SFH to validate this expectation.


8. Gradients binned by age for a model with \eta = 0 alongside a model where
	\eta \propto e^R, each with and without radial flows. Additional panels
	showing [O/H] in the gas-phase as a function of time at a selection of
	radii.

	- When \eta = 0 is combined with radial gas flows, there is significant
		"reverse evolution" across a broad range of radii in the disk.
		This ruins agreement between the predicted age-metallicity relation
		and the data.
		We expect this result to be generic due to our analytic result that the
		decline in metallicity due to gas flows grows with the slope of the
		gradient.
		That is, as soon as the gradient begins to appear, this sink becomes
		strong and lowers Z in the outer disk first, which steepens the local
		gradient there. A positive-feedback loop then ensues, which propogates
		inward and produces reverse evolution as far in as R ~ few kpc.

	- when \eta \propto e^R, this same effect can occur, but a much larger
		flow velocity is required.


9. \dot{Z}_{x,flow} computed from the \eta = 0 model and the \eta \propto e^R
model, both with radial flows.

	- Further visualizes the difference that arises in the previous figure,
		demonstrating that gas flows induce a strong sink if \eta = 0.


10. Comparison of gradients binned by age in a inside-out SFH model and a
	two-infall model, both with \eta \propto e^R, radial migration, and gas
	flows.

	- With \eta \propto e^R, one can get essentially any gradient they want by
		specifying the scale radius of the exponential profile, and the details
		of the SFH become a small effect. This lines up with the simulation
		result that we should expect a diversity of SFHs in MW-like galaxies
		and the observational result that there is not a wide range of
		diversity in abundance gradients. We expect the qualitative results of
		the two-infall model to hold when extended to the \eta \propto e^R
		scenario, but quantitatively, the timescales and relative amplitudes of
		the two infall episodes as well as the delay between them will likely
		need revised.
