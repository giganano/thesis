\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{outflows:sec:disc-conc}

We have characterized stellar age and abundance gradients in the MW as
traced by red giants in APOGEE.
As expected from inside-out growth in the~$\Lambda$CDM paradigm
\citep[e.g.,][]{White1991}, inner Galaxy stars tend to be old ($\sim$$6 - 10$
Gyr), and outer Galaxy stars tend to be young ($\sim$$2 - 6$ Gyr, see
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:age-xh-dists}).
In qualitative agreement with previous studies~\citep[e.g.,][]{Cheng2012,
Frinchaboy2013, Hayden2015, Myers2022}, characteristic stellar metallicities
decrease with increasing radius.
Distributions in both quantities are skew-negative in the inner Galaxy and
skew-positive in the outer Galaxy.
\par
The median stellar age is~$\sim$8 Gyr in the inner~$\sim$few kpc and decreases
steadily at a slope of~$\nabla\tau_{1/2} = -0.375 \pm 0.036$ Gyr/kpc.
At~$R \gtrsim 10$ kpc, the gradient flattens off and inverts sign slightly,
with the youngest median ages of~$\sim$$3.5$ Gyr occurring at~$\sim$$11 - 12$
kpc.
Stellar abundances span nearly exactly one order of magnitude across the full
extent of the disk.
The O gradient at~$\grad{O} = -0.062 \pm 0.001$ kpc$^{-1}$ is slightly
shallower than that of Fe at~$\grad{Fe} = -0.070 \pm 0.003$ kpc$^{-1}$.
This measurement of~\grad{O} is also broadly consistent with measurements
derived from Cepheid variables~\citep{Luck2011a, Luck2011b, Genovali2014,
Lemasle2018}.
Our estimates of these gradients have small statistical uncertainties due to
the large sample size, though the APOGEE selection function introduces a
significant source of systematic uncertainty which we have not quantified
(see discussion in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:results:caveats}).
\par
We then conditioned stars on their ages to measure the evolution in the
abundance gradient over time.
We find that a gradient closely resembling that of the present day was
established as long as~$\sim$9 Gyr ago in both \space \oh \space and \space \feh
\space across essentially the entire disk, with a positive slope in Fe and
flat in O immediately prior.
This result is broadly consistent with Imig et al.'s (2023, in prep.) dissection
of the stellar gradient with ages estimated from C/N ratios.
Having originally made these measurements with the~\textsc{AstroNN} APOGEE DR17
value added catalog~\citep{Mackereth2019b}, we successfully reproduced this
result with the more recent~\citet{Leung2023} age catalog, indicating that
systematics in the age and abundance determination do not impact this
conclusion (see discussion in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:results:caveats}).
There are only small perturbations after the gradient was initially set (see
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-fixed-age} and discussion
in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:results}), the significance of which is unclear given
the systematic uncertainty of the APOGEE selection function.
If significant, the fluctuations likely reflect the detailed SFH of the disk,
in particular indicating an accretion event in the outer disk about~$\sim$6 Gyr
ago.
\par
This time evolution -- or lack thereof -- in the Galaxy's metallicity gradient
is readily explained qualitatively by GCE models which invoke equilibrium
abundances.
In this scenario, solar and even super-solar abundances can be achieved within
the first couple Gyrs of chemical enrichment, after which there is little to no
evolution~\citep[e.g.,][]{Larson1972, Weinberg2017b}.
The gradient itself arises in this scenario out of changes in the
equilibrium abundance as in Chapter~\ref{migration}, though this detail of that
model was assumed rather than deduced from data.
GCE models in the literature in which abundances do not reach an equilibrium
instead predict an upward evolution in the normalization of the gradient with
time (see, e.g., Fig. 2 of~\citealt{Minchev2013}).
\par
The O gradient we measure is also consistent within~$1\sigma$
with~\citet{MendezDelgado2022}'s \citet{MendezDelgado2022} measurement in the
gas-phase, in which they carefully accounted for the temperature
inhomogeneities within HII regions.
This agreement is expected under the equilibrium scenario~\citep{Weinberg2017b}.
The decrease in abundances in the outer disk~$\sim$6 Gyr ago, if significant,
is readily explained by dilution due to accretion of metal-poor gas.
In this scenario, the infalling gas dilutes the ISM metallicity, after which O
and Fe re-enrich on different timescales in the ensuing burst
in star formation (e.g., Chapter~\ref{bursts}).
\par
Classically interpreted as a consequence of inside-out Galaxy growth
\citep{Kauffmann1996}, this equilibrium interpretation is a significant
challenge to the understanding of abundance gradients.
In the Chapter~\ref{migration} scenario, ISM gas is more readily swept up due
to feedback and ejected in an outflow with increasing radius.
It is also possible that a significant portion of SN ejecta is lost directly to
an outflow~\citep{Dalcanton2007, Peeples2011, Christensen2018, Chisholm2018,
Cameron2021}, and this fraction could in principle decrease with radius in a
corresponding fashion.
Under either interpretation, we expect the slope of a spiral galaxy's
abundance gradient to trace the slope of its gravitational potential well.
\par
We clarify that this is not a rebuttle against inside-out galaxy growth.
The evidence suggests that most of the Galactic disk reached an approximate
equilibrium abundance as long as 9 Gyr ago, after which GCE models would
suggest that it simply loses memory of its initial conditions (see discussion
in, e.g.,~\citealt{Weinberg2017b}).
We infer that the effects of inside-out growth are simply washed away and
locked up in~$\gtrsim$9 Gyr old stars.
This argument would suggest that the detailed SFH should play a minimal role
in shaping the gradient at late times, which is both predicted from simulations
and supported observationally.
\citet{Pilkington2012} demonstrate that a compilation of 25 disk galaxies from
cosmological simulations develop similar abundance gradients despite
significantly different evolutionary histories.
Based on full spectral fitting of MaNGA galaxies,~\citet{Goddard2017} also
argue that a galaxy's merger history plays a relatively small role in shaping
the abundance gradient.


% The evolution of the metallicity gradient traced by APOGEE favors GCE models in
% which it arises due to a decrease in the equilibrium abundance with radius.
% In this scenario, the equilibrium is set by the mass loading factor~$\eta$,
% which describes the efficiency with which ISM gas is swept up and ejected due
% to feedback.
% We therefore expect variations in the gravitational potential with Galactic
% region to establish this connection between~$\eta$ and radius.
% \par
% Classically interpreted as a consequence of inside-out galaxy growth
% \citep[e.g.,][]{Kauffmann1996}, this interpretation reframes abundance
% gradients as an equilibrium phenomenon whose slope traces the density profile
% of the system.
% The first principles model of~\citet{Sharda2021b} makes similar predictions.
% Once it is near equilibrium, the ISM loses memory of its initial conditions,
% and our APOGEE sample indicates this first occurred~$\sim$$9$ Gyr ago (see
% discussion in~\S~{\color{red} X}).
% The effects of inside-out galaxy growth on the MW abundance gradient should
% therefore be locked up in age~$\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr stars and at
% redshift~$z \gtrsim$ 1.5 for external galaxies.
% \par
% If this equilibrium model is accurate, then due to the relationship between
% a galaxy's mass and its scale radius {\color{red} (citation)}, a secondary
% correlation between mass and the slope of the metallicity gradient would be
% expected.
% Such a relationship is indeed observed, though there are indications that the
% trend with mass may be complicated~\citep{Belfiore2017, Maiolino2019}.
% However, the correlations are weak and the measurements are uncertain
% \citep{Yuan2013, Acharyya2020, Poetrodjojo2021}, though perhaps difficulties
% are not surprising if it is indeed a secondary correlation.
% From a simulations perspective,~\citet{Pilkington2012} find that 25 disk
% galaxies in cosmological simulations show similar abundance gradients, but
% each evolved to this self-similarity differently, as expected if chemical
% equilibrium quickly washes out the effects of the SFH.
% Based on full spectrual fitting of MaNGA galaxies,~\citet{Goddard2017} also
% argue that a galaxy's merger history plays a relatively small role in shaping
% the metallicity gradient.
