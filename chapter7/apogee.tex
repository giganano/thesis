\section{Comparison to Empirical Age and Metallicity Gradients}
\label{outflows:sec:empirical}

\subsection{The Sample}
\label{outflows:sec:empirical:apogee}
There are many spectroscopic surveys to choose from to characterize the
abundance structure of the Galactic disk, such as
LAMOST~\citep{Luo2015}, GALAH~\citep{DeSilva2015, Martell2017},~\gaia-ESO
\citep{Gilmore2012}, and APOGEE\space\citep{Majewski2017}.
APOGEE is particularly well suited to this task, because it targets luminous
evolved stars accessible at large distances and observes them at near-IR
wavelengths, which are less susceptible to dust obscuration.
The disk sample is dominated by stars with Two Micron All Sky Survey
\citep{Skrutskie2006} magnitudes of~$7 < H < 13.8$ on a grid of sightlines at
Galactic latitudes of~$b = 0$,~$\pm 4^\circ$, and~$\pm 8^\circ$; targeting is
described in detail by~\citet{Zasowski2013, Zasowski2017},~\citet{Beaton2021},
and~\citet{Santana2021}.
APOGEE collects high-resolution spectra ($R \sim$ 22,500) between~$1.51$
and~$1.70~\mu$m~\citep{Wilson2019} on the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope
\citep{Gunn2006} at Apache Point Observatory and the 2.5 m du Pont
Telescope~\citep{Bowen1973} at Las Campanas Observatory, which are then
reduced and calibrated using the APOGEE data processing pipeline
\citep{Nidever2015}.
Stellar parameters such as~$T_\text{eff}$,~$\log g$, and abundances of 15 or
more elements per target star are then computed with the APOGEE Stellar
Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline~\citep[ASPCAP;][]{Holtzman2015,
GarciaPerez2016}.
\par
In this chapter, we select stars from the seventeenth data
release~\citep[DR17;][]{Abdurrouf2022} that satisfy the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}

	\item \texttt{EXTRATARG == 0}

	\item \texttt{STAR\_BAD == 0}

	\item S/N~$\geq 80$

	\item $\log g = 1 - 3.8$

	\item $T_\text{eff} = 3500 - 5500$ K

\end{itemize}
To avoid contamination by the main sequence, we additionally exclude stars
with surface gravities of~$\log g > 3$ and effective temperatures of
$T_\text{eff} < 4000$ K.
These cuts yield a final sample of 191,173 red giant and red clump stars.
\par
Since one of the central interests to this chapter is to constrain the
evolution of the abundance gradient over time, we also use star-by-star ages
from~\citet{Mackereth2019b}.
Using the deep learning algorithms available through~\textsc{AstroNN}
\citep{Leung2019},~\citet{Mackereth2019b} trained a Bayesian convolutional
neural network on APOGEE spectra and asteroseismic data from the APOKASC-2
catalog~\citep{Pinsonneault2018}.
We discuss the impact of this decision
in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:empirical:caveats} below, particularly with regard to
how this age catalog compares to the more recent~\citet{Leung2023} estimates.

legend.
Within each age bin, we plot only a random subsample of~$N = 5000$ stars.
}
\label{outflows:fig:kiel-diagram}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:kiel-diagram} shows the Kiel diagram of a subsample of
our stars binned by age.
Comparing the distributions of stars along the red giant branch and red clump
between age bins indicates some systematic biases present in the sample.
The youngest stars are preferentially located in the red clump, whereas the
oldest stars distribute themselves much more evenly along the red giant branch.
This result is unsurprising as systematic uncertainties in APOGEE tend to
present as spurious correlations with~$T_\text{eff}$ and~$\log g$
\citep[e.g.,][]{Joensson2018, Eilers2022}.
However, we do not expect these systematic effects to impact our
characterizations of radial age and metallicity gradients (see discussion
in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:empirical:caveats} below).

Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:age-xh-dists} shows age and abundance distributions of
our sample in bins of Galactocentric radius.
Stars tend to be young in the outer Galaxy, with the age distributions peaking
around~$\sim$$2-4$ Gyr at~$R_\text{gal} \gtrsim 9$ kpc and a tail toward older
ages.
As radius increases, the age distribution shifts to a peak at older ages and a
skew-negative tail.
This result is a natural consequence of inside-out Galaxy formation, whereby
the inner regions of the disk assemble at high redshift and the outer regions
follow suit on longer timescales~\citep[e.g.,][]{White1991, Bird2013}.
Abundances follow a similar pattern, shifting from a metal-rich mode and
skew-negative tail to a metal-poor mode and skew-positive tail with increasing
radius, a result previously found in APOGEE by~\citet{Hayden2015}.
These shifts in the characteristic properties of stellar populations are
indicative of radial gradients in the Galaxy, which we quantify in detail
below.


\subsection{Radial Gradients}
\label{outflows:sec:empirical:gradients}

\begin{figure*}

\end{figure*}
% Although there is no analytic expression for the peak, given the mean~$\mu$ and
% standard deviation~$\sigma$ of the corresponding unskewed distribution, an
% accurate numerical approximation is given by~$\mu + m_0 \sigma$, where
% \begin{equation}
% m_0 \equiv \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}
% \left[
% \delta - \left(\frac{4 - \pi}{2}\right)
% \frac{\delta^3}{\pi - 2\delta^2}
% \right] - \frac{\text{sign}(a)}{2} e^{-2\pi / \left|a\right|}
% \end{equation}
% for~$\delta \equiv a / \sqrt{1 + a^2}$ defined in terms of the skewness
% parameter~$a$~\citep{Azzalini2014}.

To quantify the gradients in our sample, we first sort stars into 1-kpc wide
bins in Galactocentric radius.
We then compute the median age~$\tau_{1/2}$ and the 16th and 84th percentiles
of the distribution by simply sorting the values into ascending order.
The left panel of Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-gradage} shows the results of
this procedure.
Our sample is large enough that bootstrap error estimates indicate statistical
uncertainties smaller than the points in the figure.
A linear regression on the medians suggests an age gradient
of~$\gradage = -0.375 \pm 0.036$ Gyr/kpc with an intercept of~$8.21 \pm 0.31$
Gyr.
The median age closely follows this line of best fit at
$R_\text{gal} \lesssim 9$ kpc, but flattens off in the outer disk and reverses
sign slightly.
\par
Though we quantify the age gradient in terms of the median trend, the mode is
our summary statistic of choice in quantifying metallicity gradients.
We discuss our motivation behind this choice in~\S~{\color{red} X}.
In short, our GCE models suggest that the mode is not significantly affected
by stellar migration, {\color{red} except perhaps in the outermost regions of
the disk(?).}
Consequently, its variations should reflect the enrichment histories of
different Galactic regions with little contamination.
Because the mode is a noisy statistic, we fit a skewed normal distribution to
the MDF in each radial bin and determine the mode by optimization.
We however estimate the 16th and 84th percentiles by simply sorting the
abundances into ascending order as we did for the age distributions.
\par
The right panel of Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-gradage} shows the resultant
gradients in~\oh~and~\feh.
As expected given the MDFs in Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:age-xh-dists}, stars tend
to decline in metallicity with increasing radius.
Linear regressions indicate slopes of~$\grad{O} = -0.062 \pm 0.001$ kpc$^{-1}$
and~$\grad{Fe} = -0.070 \pm 0.003$ kpc$^{-1}$, in reasonable agreement with
previous measurements (see discussion in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:intro} and
references therein).
Our GCE models {\color{red} successfully(?)} reproduce the slightly steeper
slope in Fe; we describe the origin of this result in~\S~{\color{red} X}.
For comparison, we plot~\citeauthor{MendezDelgado2022}'s
\citeyearpar{MendezDelgado2022} fit to the O gradient in the ISM as traced by
Galactic HII regions and accounting for their temperature inhomogeneities.

\label{outflows:fig:gradxh-vs-age}
\end{figure}

As a central interest of this chapter is to quantify the evolution of the
Galactic abundance gradient over time, we now repeat these measurements
conditioned on stellar age.
In conditioning on both age and radius, we fit for the mode of the MDF only in
bins containing at least 200 stars.
This is a sufficiently large sample in each bin such that bootstrap resampling
indicates statistial uncertainties in the mode comparable to the width of the
lines plotted ($\lesssim0.1\%$).
\par
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-fixed-age} shows the gradients themselves in each
age bin.
We also report slopes and intercepts from linear regressions to the trend in
each age bin in Table~\ref{outflows:tab:apogee-regression} and visualize the
inferred gradients in Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-vs-age}.
To first order, the gradient was established~$\sim$$8 - 9$ Gyr ago.
In the oldest age bin, the abundance profile is consistent with flat in~\oh~but
is positively sloped in~\feh.
The gradient held relatively steady at~$\grad{O} \approx \grad{Fe} \approx
-0.05$ kpc$^{-1}$ for~$\sim$3 Gyr, then steepened to~$\grad{O} \approx -0.07$
kpc$^{-1}$ and~$\grad{Fe} \approx -0.09$ kpc$^{-1}$ before gradually returning
to~$\grad{O} \approx \grad{Fe} \approx -0.05$ kpc$^{-1}$ until the present day.
Inspection of fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-fixed-age} indicates that the
steepening of the gradient coincides with a decrease in metallicity
of~$\sim$$0.2 - 0.3$ dex in O and~$\sim$$0.4 - 0.5$ dex in Fe
at~$R_\text{gal} \gtrsim$8 kpc.
\par

This result is readily explained by a dilution event due to accretion of
metal-poor gas in the outer disk.
A decrease in metallicity indicates that the enrichment rate and by extension
the SFR are slow relative to the infall rate.
A burst in star formation driven by the increased resources then naturally
ensues~\citep[e.g.,][]{Dalcanton2007}.
The differences in both the magnitude of the dilution in
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-fixed-age} and the timescales in
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:gradxh-vs-age} between O and Fe are expected under this
scenario.
[O/H] and [Fe/H] decrease by the same amount only the limit that the
accretion event is instantaneous~\citep{Johnson2020}, and O re-enrichment is
faster due to the restitution delay of SN Ia Fe yields.

\subsection{Caveats}
\label{outflows:sec:empirical:caveats}
Because the~\citet{Mackereth2019b} age catalog is produced by training on APOGEE
spectra, it is possible that their estimates are biased by known trends of
abundances with stellar age (e.g., the age-[O/Fe] relation;
\citealt{Feuillet2019}).
To mitigate this potential issue,~\citet{Leung2023} take APOGEE stars with
high-cadence photometry available through~\textit{Kepler}~\citep{Borucki2010}
and compress the spectra and asteroseismic power spectra into lower dimensional
representations of themselves (i.e., a~\textit{latent space}) using a
variational encoder-decoder algorithm~\citep[e.g.,][]{LeCun2015}.
They demonstrate that this latent space contains little if any information on
chemical abundances and stellar parameters, as intended.
By augmenting the latent space with~$T_\text{eff}$ and~\feh, they are then able
to estimate ages for stars with asteroseismic power spectra predicted from
their APOGEE spectra with a modified random forest algorithm.
\par
To assess whether or not potential biases introduced by
the~\citet{Mackereth2019b} catalog impact our determination of the abundance
gradient conditioned on stellar age, we have reconducted the analysis in this
section with the~\citet{Leung2023} sample.
The results obtained with either catalog are consistent with one another,
suggesting that ages biased by abundance information in stellar spectra are not
significantly impacting our conclusions.
We have therefore focused our discussion on the~\citet{Mackereth2019b} catalog
as it offers a handful of advantages that are useful to the present chapter.
While~\citet{Mackereth2019b} infer ages for the entire APOGEE catalog,
\citet{Leung2023} only do so for the range of surface gravities spanned by
their training set ($\log_{10} g = 2.5 - 3.6$).
As a result, the sample is a factor of~$\sim$$2.5$ smaller, yielding much more
precise summary statistics in radial bins with the~\citet{Mackereth2019b}
catalog.
This decision also allows us to use luminous, low surface gravity red giants
for better coverage of the Galactic disk.
Though the~\citet{Mackereth2019b} catalog exhibits a deficit of stars at old
ages (i.e.,~$\gtrsim 10$ Gyr; see Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:age-xh-dists} and Fig.
11 of~\citealt{Leung2023}), this should not be a problem for the present
chapter since we do not characterize the abundance gradient for such stars.
