\section{Galactic Chemical Evolution Models}
\label{outflows:sec:gce}
We use GCE models to shed light on the origin of the disk abundance gradient,
drawing on both one-zone~\citep[e.g.,][]{Tinsley1980, Pagel2009, Matteucci2021}
and multi-zone models~\citep[e.g.,][]{Schoenrich2009a, Minchev2013,
Minchev2014, Chen2023}.
The fundamental assumption of one-zone models is that newly produced metals
mix instantaneously in the star forming ISM.
This approximation sacrifices spatial information in exchange for a reduction
in computational expense, reducing GCE to a system of coupled
integro-differential equations of mass with time.
Multi-zone models add some spatial information back to this framework by
coupling a series of one-zone models via the exchange of gas and stars.
We focus most of our quantitative discussion on our multi-zone models.
Rather than detailed solutions, our one-zone models provide an analytic
framework that is useful for qualitative interpretation.

% To understand the origin of the disk abundance gradient, we use the multi-ring
% GCE models of Chapter~\ref{migration} and extend them to incorporate radial
% gas flows~\citep[e.g.,][]{Lacey1985, Bilitewski2012}.
% We also extend the analytic framework of~\citet{Weinberg2017b} to incorporate
% the effects of radial gas flows.

% We now construct GCE models to understand the origin of the radial age and
% metallicity gradients characterized in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:empirical}.
% To this end, we construct models describing the Galaxy disk as a series of
% one-zone models like those in Chapters~\ref{bursts} and~\ref{dga} and
% multi-ring models like those in Chapters~\ref{migration} and~\ref{ohno}.
% Though similar, the former does not incorporate mixing of stellar populations
% while the latter does.
% We also extend these models to incorporate radial gas
% flows~\citep[e.g.,][]{Lacey1985, Bilitewski2012}.
% We present models with numerical solutions predicted by multi-ring GCE models
% of the Galactic disk accounting for both stellar migration and radial flows
% (see~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:gce:multizone}), alongside which we develop an
% analytic framework useful for qualitative interpretation
% (see~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:gce:onezone:analytic}).

\subsection{Multi-Zone Models}
\label{outflows:sec:gce:multizone}

\begin{figure}

\caption{
A schematic of our multi-ring models illustrating how we handle the flow of gas
between annuli.
At each timestep, the fraction of gas that migrates inward is determined from
the ratio of areas between the [$R$,~$R + v_g \Delta t$) and
[$R$,~$R + \Delta R$) annuli.
}
\label{outflows:fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

Our multi-ring models are adapted from Chapter~\ref{migration}.
We describe the extensions made for the sake of this chapter, but otherwise
refer to~\S~\ref{migration:sec:methods} for further details.
A shorter summary of this model can also be found
in~\S~\ref{ohno:sec:multizone}.
\par
First and foremost, we extend these models to incorporate the effects of radial
gas flows.
Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:schematic} shows a schematic of our parameterization.
A natural consequence of accretion, radial gas flows occur due to the specific
angular momentum of the ISM lowering due to the infalling gas~\citep{Lacey1985,
Bilitewski2012}.
Consequently, each annulus generally experiences a net gain from its outer
neighbor and a net loss to its inner neighbor.
In the limit of a single, characteristic inward flow velocity~$v_g < 0$, all of
the gas in the range [$R$,~$R - v_g \Delta t$) will move in one annulus over
the course of a single~$\Delta t$ timestep.
The ratio of areas between the [$R$,~$R - v_g \Delta t$) and
[$R$,~$R + \Delta R$) annuli then determines the rate of loss due to flows.
The total flow rate, including the rate of gain from an annulus's outer
neighbor, is then given by
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\dot{M}_{g,\flow} &= M_g(R + \Delta R) \frac{
	v_g(R + \Delta R)^2 \Delta t - 2 (R + \Delta R) v_g
}{
	2 (R + \Delta R) \Delta R + \Delta R^2
} -
\\
&\qquad M_g(R) \frac{
	v_g(R)^2 \Delta t - 2 R v_g
}{
	2 R \Delta R + \Delta R^2
},
\label{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-flow-areafrac}
\end{split}\end{equation}
where we have converted from the change in mass to a rate by dividing by the
timestep size.
The rate of change in the metal mass then follows similarly by multiplying the
gain term by~$Z_x(R + \Delta R)$ and the loss term by~$Z_x(R)$ for a given
element~$x$.
\par
As in previous chapters, we integrate our models with the
\textsc{Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution} (\vice; see
Chapter~\ref{bursts}).
\vice~allows users to specify the fractional rate of gas exchange between any
pair of zones, so we simply give it the factors related to the area fraction of
each annulus in equation~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-flow-areafrac} above.
The effects of the gas moving between rings then arise naturally in its
timestep integrator by simply bookkeeping the changes in mass.
We demonstrate in Appendix~\ref{outflows:sec:coefficients-derivation} that the
rates of change due to gas flows have mathematically well defined forms,
which we present and discuss in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:gce:onezone} below.
\par
We modify the stellar migration prescription from Chapter~\ref{migration} as
well.
There, we assigned each stellar population in our model an ``analogue'' from
the~\hsim~hydrodynamical simulation~\citep{Christensen2012, Loebman2012,
Loebman2014, Zolotov2012, Brooks2014}.
An analogue is simply a randomly chosen star particle that was born at a
similar radius and time.
Here, we perturb stellar populations from their birth radius by a displacement
randomly sampled from a normal distribution based on arguments in,
e.g.,~\citet{Frankel2018}.
Our model is described in more detail by Dubay et al. (2023, in prep.). 
In short, we fit simple power-laws to the standard deviation of displacement
as a function of radius and age to the~\hsim~star particles.
With a stellar population's sampled orbital displacement in hand, it then
migrates to its implied final radius with a~$\tau^{1/3}$ age dependence as
opposed to the~$\tau^{1/2}$ dependence from Chapter~\ref{migration}.
While we simply took the final midplane distance~$\left|z\right|$ from~\hsim~in
Chapter~\ref{migration}, we randomly sample the midplane distances from
a~$\text{sech}^2(z / 2h_z)$ distribution, where we also fit simple power-laws
to~$h_z$ as a function of radius and age from~\hsim.


\subsection{Analytic Framework}
\label{outflows:sec:gce:onezone}
Our analytic framework is a simple extension of~\citet{Weinberg2017b}. We
provide an overview of the essential details and quantities involved here and
refer to their~\S~2 for further details.
In a one-zone model, the rate of change of the ISM mass~$M_g$ is given by a
simple sum of source and sink terms
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\dot{M}_g &= \dot{M}_\text{in} - \dot{M}_\star - \dot{M}_\text{out} +
\dot{M}_r
\\
&\approx \dot{M}_\text{in} - \dot{M}_\star(1 + \eta - r),
\label{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-noflow}
\end{split}\end{equation}
where~$\dot{M}_\text{in}$ is the accretion rate,~$\dot{M}_\star$ is the SFR,
$\dot{M}_\text{out} \equiv \eta \dot{M}_\star$ is the outflow rate, and
$\dot{M}_r \approx r\dot{M}_\star$ is the return rate of recycled stellar
envelopes to the ISM.
Though the recycling rate in detail is a complex function of age (see
discussion in~\S~\ref{bursts:sec:crf}), it is sufficiently accurate for the
sake of analytic approximations to assume a constant value ($r \approx 4$ for
a~\citealt{Kroupa2001} IMF).
\par
As discussed in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:intro}, the ``mass loading factor''
$\eta$ is of central interest to this chapter.
This coefficient quantifies how much ambient ISM is swept up and ejected with
an outflow due to massive star and SN feedback.
The value of~$\eta$ sets the equilibrium abundance at which metal losses to
outflows is balanced by production by new stars~\citep[see also][]{Larson1974}.
A general expression for the equilibrium abundance, which is accurate up to a
small correction factor for a specific element's delay time distribution (DTD),
is given by
\begin{equation}
Z_{x,\eq} = \frac{y_x}{1 + \eta - r - \tau_\star / \tau_\text{sfh}},
\label{outflows:eq:zx-eq}
\end{equation}
where~\timescale{sfh}~is the e-folding timescale of an exponential SFH,
and~$\tau_\star \equiv \dot{M}_\star / M_g$ is the inverse of the star
formation efficiency (SFE).
The SFE timescale is often referred to as the ``depletion time'' in the
observational literature on star formation in galaxies, but we retain this
nomencature as the depletion time of the ISM in these models can be
significantly shorter than~$\tau_\star$ in the presence of outflows (see
discussion below).
\par
In Chapter~\ref{migration}, we set the value of~$\eta$ as a function of radius
so that a radial abundance gradient arose as a consequence of variations in
the equilibrium abundance.
Specifically, it follows from equation~\refp{outflows:eq:zx-eq} that
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{y_x}{Z_{x,\odot}}
e^{(R - R_\odot) / R_x} + r + \tau_\star / \timescale{sfh} - 1,
\end{equation}
where~$R_x = -(\grad{X} \ln 10)^{-1}$ is the scale radius required for a
gradient slope~\grad{X}.
In this scenario for the abundance gradient, the slope is~\textit{input} to the
model as opposed to a prediction, though it can be impacted by, e.g., stellar
migration and radial gas flows.
\par
{\color{red} (stopped edits here)} In the present chapter, we focus on the
abundances of alpha and
iron-peak elements whose production is dominated by SNe
\citep[e.g.,][]{Johnson2019}.
We take O and Fe as the prototypical elements from these categories, though
we expect our GCE models to make similar predictions if we chose different
elements to compute abundances for.
The rate of change of the mass of some element~$x$ in the ISM can be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_x = \ycc{$x$} \dot{M}_\star +
\yia{$x$} \langle \dot{M}_\star \rangle_\text{Ia} -
Z_x \dot{M}_\star \left(1 + \eta - r\right),
\label{outflows:eq:mdot-element-noflow}
\end{equation}
where~$Z_x$ is the abundance by mass of~$x$ in the ISM at a given moment in
time and~\ycc{$x$} and~\yia{$x$} are the population-averaged yields of~$x$
from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
respectively.
This parameterization assumes that all CCSNe yields are ejected immediately
following a stellar population's formation, which is valid as long as the
timescales of Galaxy evolution are significantly longer than the lifetimes
of massive stars.
Enrichment by SNe Ia is instead weighted by a delay-time distribution (DTD),
for which we retain the~$t^{-1.1}$ formalism from previous chapters as
suggested by comparisons of the cosmic SFH~\citep[e.g.,][]{Madau2017,
Driver2018} with volumetric SN Ia rates as a function of
redshift~\citep{Maoz2012a, Maoz2012b, Graur2013, Graur2014}.
\par
\citet{Weinberg2017b} demonstrate that the first-order details of the
enrichment history of alpha and iron-peak elements are established by
the mass-loading factor~$\eta$ and the star formation efficiency (SFE)
timescale~$\tau_\star \equiv M_g / \dot{M}_\star$ relating the
gas supply and the star formation rate (SFR).
The SFE timescale sets the position of the ``knee'' in the~\afe-\feh~plane,
while~$\eta$ controls the equilibrium abundance at which enrichment is
balanced by losses to outflows, which sets the end-point of the track.
The detailed form of the SFH has little impact, instead influencing how
stars distribute themselves along the track.
However, the detailed SFH has much more impact on the abundance evolution
in the~$\eta = 0$ scenario.
In this case, radial gas flows~\citep[e.g.,][]{Lacey1985}
also have a much stronger effect since the substantial sink term of
outflows is removed.
\par
To this end, we construct a parameterization for including the effects of
radial gas flows in one-zone GCE models.
We introduce the unitless coefficients~$\gamma_\flow$ and~$\mu_\text{flow}$
defined such that the rates of change of the gas supply and an element~$x$ due
to flows can be expressed in terms of the SFR and~$Z_x$ according to
\begin{subequations}\begin{align}
\dot{M}_{g,\flow} &= \dot{M}_\star \gamma_\flow
\label{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-flow}
\\
\dot{M}_{x,\flow} &= Z_x \dot{M}_\star \mu_\flow.
\label{outflows:eq:mdot-element-flow}
\end{align}\end{subequations}
Equations~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-noflow}
and~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-element-noflow} then become
\begin{subequations}\begin{align}
\dot{M}_{g} &\rightarrow \dot{M}_\text{in} - \dot{M}_\star
\left(1 + \eta - r - \gamma_\flow\right)
\\
\dot{M}_x &\rightarrow \ycc{$x$} \dot{M}_\star +
\yia{$x$} \langle \dot{M}_\star \rangle_\text{Ia} -
Z_x \dot{M}_\star \left(1 + \eta - r - \mu_\flow\right).
\end{align}\end{subequations}
The most general forms of these flow coefficients are given by
\begin{subequations}\begin{align}
\gamma_\flow &\equiv -\tau_\star v_g \left[
\frac{1}{R} +
\frac{\partial \ln \Sigma_g}{\partial R} +
\frac{\partial \ln v_g}{\partial R}
\right]
\label{outflows:eq:gamma-flow-general}
\\
\mu_\flow &\equiv -\tau_\star v_g \left[
\frac{1}{R} + \frac{\partial \ln \Sigma_g}{\partial R} +
\frac{\partial \ln v_g}{\partial R} +
\frac{\partial \ln Z_x}{\partial R}
\right],
\label{outflows:eq:mu-flow-general}
\end{align}\end{subequations}
where~$v_g$ is the radial velocity of the ISM gas and~$\Sigma_g$ is its surface
density.
Though the ISM in nature has a distribution of radial velocities, this
parameterization assumes a single characteristic velocity at a given radius.
The bulk flow is generally directed inward (i.e.,~$v_g < 0$; hence the minus
signs), which arises due to the angular momentum of the disk being diluted by
freshly accreted material and falling toward the Galactic center
\citep[see discussion in, e.g.,][]{Bilitewski2012}.
These equalities should hold even when each of the quantities are allowed to be
arbitrary, continuous functions of time, but they are only as accurate as the
assumptions outlined in Appendix~\ref{outflows:sec:coefficients-derivation}.
We reserve detailed derivations of~$\gamma_\flow$ and~$\mu_\flow$ for
Appendix~\ref{outflows:sec:coefficients-derivation}, providing only
qualitative justification of their functional forms here.
\par
The linear dependence on~$v_g$ is expected.
As the flow velocity increases, its effect on enrichment rates and the gas
supply increases proportionally.
The dependence on the velocity profile is also intuitive.
For example, if the radial velocity slows as it falls due to, e.g., mixing with
higher density ISM on a less eccentric orbit, then its possible for material to
enter an annulus faster than it is leaving, leading to a ``pile-up.''
The linear dependence on~$\tau_\star$ arises because these rates are tied to
the local gas supply.
When multiplied by the SFR in equations~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-gas-flow}
and~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-element-flow},~$\dot{M}_\star \tau_\star$ becomes
$M_g$ by definition.
Both coefficients depend on fluctuations in the ISM surface density since any
variation thereof will affect how much gas is exchanged between neighboring
annuli.
The metal flow coefficient~$\mu_\flow$ additionally depends on the abundance
gradient for similar reasons.
For an inward flow, any given annulus will be replenished with less gas and
less metals from the next annulus at~$R + \Delta R$ if both decrease steeply
with radius.
Lastly, both coefficients have an explicit~$1 / R$ dependence on radius which
arises due to the change in area~$2 \pi R \Delta R$.
Though a pile-up can occur due to the radial velocity profile, this term
describes the inevitable pile-up near the Galactic center as the infalling
material converges.
\par
For a typical spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, the surface density of gas is
often described as an exponential
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_g \propto e^{-R / R_g},
\end{equation}
where~$R_g$ is some scale radius.
Similarly, abundance gradients are generally characterized as linear in [X/H],
which then translates to an exponential~$Z_x \propto e^{-R / R_x}$ in the
metal mass fraction.
Under these conditions, equations~\refp{outflows:eq:gamma-flow-general}
and~\refp{outflows:eq:mu-flow-general} become
\begin{subequations}\begin{align}
\gamma_\flow &\rightarrow -\tau_\star v_g
\left(\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R_g}\right)
\label{outflows:eq:gamma-flow}
\\
\mu_\flow &\rightarrow -\tau_\star v_g
\left(\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R_g} - \frac{1}{R_x}\right),
\label{outflows:eq:mu-flow}
\end{align}\end{subequations}
where~$R_x \equiv -(\grad{X}~\ln 10)^{-1}$ is the implied scale radius of the
abundance gradient in~$x$.
For~$\grad{x} \approx -0.06$ dex/kpc as found
in~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:empirical},~$R_x \approx 7.2$ kpc.
\par
In principle, both~$\gamma_\flow$ and~$\mu_\flow$ should be affected by changes
in~$\tau_\star$ with radius.
In particular, the low surface densities at large radii would imply inefficient
star formation~\citep[i.e., higher~$\tau_\star$; e.g.,][]{delosReyes2019,
Kennicutt2021}.
Combining a power-law scaling between~$\Sigma_g$ and the surface density of
star formation~$\dot{\Sigma}_\star$ with an exponential decline in~$\Sigma_g$
yields the following scaling of~$\tau_\star$ with radius:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\Sigma_g \tau_\star^{-1} &\propto \Sigma_g^N
\\
\implies \tau_\star &\propto \Sigma_g^{1 - N}
\\
\implies \tau_\star &= \tau_{\star,0} e^{(N - 1) R / R_g},
\end{split}\end{equation}
where~$\tau_{\star,0}$ is a normalizing constant specifying the efficiency of
star formation at~$R = 0$.
If~$N \approx 1.5$, consistent with the measurements of integrated SFRs and
surface densities in star forming spirals from~\citet{Kennicutt1998}, then
the scale radius that the SFE timescale increases over is exactly twice that
of the gas disk itself.
Based on the presence of the central molecular zone in the Milky Way
\citep[e.g.,][]{Morris1996, Dahmen1998, PiercePrice2000, Hatchfield2020} and
\citeauthor{Leroy2008}'s~\citeyearpar{Leroy2008} measurement that
$\tau_\star = 2$ Gyr for molecular gas,~$\tau_{\star,0} = 2$ Gyr is a
reasonable fiducial value.

\begin{figure*}

Each panel then shows variations in one of these four parameters according to
the legends in the lower right.

the boundary between a radial flow acting as a source versus a sink of metals
and gas, respectively.
}
\label{outflows:fig:flow-coefficients-vs-radius}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:flow-coefficients-vs-radius} shows~$\mu_\flow$
and~$\gamma_\flow$ as a function of radius for different parameter choices.
By definition, radial flows are a~\textit{source} of metals when~$\mu_\flow > 0$
and a~\textit{sink} when~$\mu_\flow < 0$; the same is true of the gas supply
with~$\gamma_\flow$.
In general, radial flows are a sink of both gas and metals across most of the
Galactic disk, becoming a source term only at radii better associated with the
bulge.
We expect this result to be generic as the negative sign arises due to the
difference between~$1 / R$, which varies, and~$1 / R_g + 1 / R_x$, which is
constant for a given parameter selection.
Flows are however a stronger sink for metals than gas under this
parameterization since, by definition,~$\mu_\flow = \gamma_\flow + \tau_\star
v_g / R_x$ and~$v_g < 0$.
Both~$\tau_{\star,0}$ and~$v_g$ are normalizing factors on the flow
coefficients, so they do not impact the radius at which~$\mu_\flow = 0$ or
$\gamma_\flow = 0$, but increases in their values make flows a stronger sink
where they are a sink and a stronger source where they are a source.
Changes in the slopes of gradients, either metallicity or gas surface density,
impact the flow rates in an intuitive manner: they are a stronger sink for more
sharply declining gradients as the mass or metallicity at~$R + \Delta R$ is
smaller in these cases.
Interestingly, the exact slope of the metallicity gradient~\grad{X} has minimal
impact on~$\mu_\flow$, potentially indicating that radial flows in turn have
minimal impact on abundance gradients.

\subsubsection{Analytic Solutions to Simple Cases}
\label{outflows:sec:gce:onezone:analytic}
Given a handful of simplifying assumptions, one-zone models often allow
analytic solutions to the abundance by mass~$Z_x \equiv M_x / M_g$ as a
function of time.
Under the approximation that the SN Ia DTD is a simple exponential followed by
some minimum delay,~\citet{Weinberg2017b} obtain solutions for~$Z_\text{O}$
and~$Z_\text{Fe}$ within the formalism of equations~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-gas}
and~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-element}.
With the additional approximation that~$\mu_\flow$ is constant in time, which
we expect to be accurate up to~$\sim$8 Gyr ago based on the results
of~\S~\ref{outflows:sec:empirical}, the derivation proceeds similarly under the
simple transformation~$1 + \eta - r \rightarrow 1 + \eta - r - \mu_\flow$.
We briefly discuss this extension of the~\citet{Weinberg2017b} results here and
refer readers to their~\S\S~2 and 3 for further details.
\par
The primary complication of the parameterization arises because
$\mu_\flow \neq \gamma_\flow$.
This inequality is a consequence of the radial metallicity gradient, which
lowers the metallicity of inward flowing gas.
% Fig.~\ref{outflows:fig:flow-coefficients-vs-radius} indicates that the amount
% of mass lost from a given~$\Delta R$ annulus at Galactocentric radii outside of
% the bulge over the course of some~$\Delta t$ timestep is replaced not only by
% less gas, but lower metallicity gas.
As a consequence, the~\textit{depletion time} of metals is shorter than that of
the bulk gas.
That is, in the absence of accretion (which would affect only the gas supply if
it is zero metallicity), metals spend less time than non-metals within a given
ISM fluid element before being incorporated into new stars or lost to an
outflow or the radial flow.
\par
These timescales are defined as
\begin{subequations}\begin{align}
\timescale{dep,g} &\equiv \frac{M_g}{
	\dot{M}_\star + \dot{M}_\text{out} - \dot{M}_r - \dot{M}_{g,\flow}
} = \frac{\tau_\star}{1 + \eta - r - \gamma_\flow}
\\
\timescale{dep,$x$} &\equiv \frac{M_x}{
	Z_x\left(\dot{M}_\star + \dot{M}_\text{out} - \dot{M}_r - \dot{M}_{x,\flow}
	\right)
} = \frac{\tau_\star}{1 + \eta - r - \mu_\flow},
\end{align}\end{subequations}
and both reduce to the~\citet{Weinberg2017b} form
$\timescale{dep} = \tau_\star / (1 + \eta - r)$ in the absence of a radial
flow (i.e.,~$v_g = 0 \implies \mu_\flow = \gamma_\flow = 0$).
In Appendix~\ref{outflows:sec:gce-supplement}, we demonstrate that their form
of~\timescale{dep} should be replaced with the metal depletion time as opposed
to the gas depletion time.
% A generic expression for~$\dot{Z}_x$ can be derived by differentiating
% $Z_x = M_x / (\dot{M}_\star \tau_\star)$ with time and substituting in
% equation~\refp{outflows:eq:mdot-element-flow}, carrying~$\mu_\flow$ as opposed
% to~$\gamma_\flow$ through the derivation.

As we are primarily interested in this analytic framework for qualitative
interpretation, we focus this component of our investigation on O.
This simplifies the parameterization as Fe abundances are additionally affected
by SN Ia enrichment (see discussion in~\S~X.Y.Z below), and the expressions
lend qualitative insight into the predicted Fe abundances anyway.
Applying our transformation to the~\citet{Weinberg2017b} formalism results in
the following expression for the equilibrium O abundance for the
linear-exponential and pure exponential SFHs:
\begin{equation}
Z_{\text{O,eq}} =
\frac{\ycc{O}}{1 + \eta - r - \mu_\flow - \tau_\star / \timescale{sfh}}.
\label{outflows:eq:z-o-eq}
\end{equation}
In Appendix~\ref{outflows:sec:gce-supplement}, we demonstrate that the
equilibrium abundance is the same for the ``inside-out'' SFH from
Chapter~\ref{migration}.
Of these three separate SFHs, the full time evolution of~$Z_x$ is given by
\begin{equation}
{Z}_\text{O}(t) = Z_\text{O,eq} f_\text{sfh}(t),
\label{outflows:eq:fsfh-definition}
\end{equation}
where~$f_\text{sfh}$ is some unitless function that depends on the SFH and
specifies the detailed evolution toward equilibrium with time.
Table~\ref{outflows:tab:f-sfh-forms} presents the time-dependence of these
SFHs and the associated forms of~$f_\text{sfh}$, where the timescale~$\tau_\psi$
is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\tau_\psi \equiv \left(
