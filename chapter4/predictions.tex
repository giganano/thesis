The left panel of Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:specia_metdep} shows the specific SN Ia rate
as a function of~$\gamma$ in comparison to the~$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia} /
\mstar \sim \mstar^{-0.5}$ and~$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia} / \mstar \sim
\mstar^{-0.3}$ scalings of the observed rate with the~\citet{Bell2003} and
\citet{Baldry2012} SMFS, respectively.
The metallicity dependence has a significant impact only below
$\mstar \approx 3\times10^9~\msun$ due to the shape of the MZR;
this is the mass above which the MZR flattens considerably (see
Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:sfh_mzr}).
Assuming no metallicity dependence (i.e.~$\gamma = 0$), these calculations
suggest that the variations in SFHs between~$\sim$$10^{7.2}$ and
$\sim$$10^{10}~\msun$ can account for only a factor of~$\sim$2 increase in the
specific SN Ia rate.
The~$\gamma = -0.5$ case is generally consistent with a mass dependence
of~$\mstar^{-0.3}$, while the steeper dependence of~$\mstar^{-0.5}$ would
require a stronger scaling of roughly~$\gamma \approx -1.5$.
\par
In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:specia_metdep}, we compare the same
scalings to the close binary fractions in APOGEE measured by~\citet{Moe2019}.
The line at~$Z \approx 10^{-0.6} Z_\odot$ is the characteristic abundance of
an~$\mstar = 10^{7.2}~\msun$ galaxy in the~\citet{Zahid2014} parametrization.
For the range of metallicities spanned by the stellar masses we explore here,
the close binary fraction is remarkably consistent with a~$\gamma = -0.5$
scaling with metallicity.
If one instead takes~$Z \approx 0.1Z_\odot$ for a~$\sim$$10^{7.2}~\msun$ galaxy
as suggested by~\citet{Andrews2013}, then there is a slight tension between a
$\gamma = -0.5$ scaling and the close binary fraction measured by
\citet{Moe2019}.
There is some additional freedom to adjust the metallicity dependence beyond
that of binaries, so the agreement need not be perfect.
For example, any additional increase in the SN Ia rates not supplied by an
increased binary fraction could arise due to more massive WDs forming at
low~$Z$ -- the scenario postuled by~\citet{Kistler2013}.
Nonetheless, it appears that the scaling of the close binary fraction with
metallicity can explain the majority of the effect if rate scales with mass as
$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia} / \mstar \sim \mstar^{-0.3}$.
If, instead, the~$\sim$$\mstar^{-0.5}$ scaling found using the~\citet{Bell2003}
SMF is accurate, then the required~$\gamma \approx -1.5$ scaling cannot be
explained by the close binary fraction alone as it would reach unphysical
values ($>1$) within the range of observed metallicities.
\par
Due to the evolution of the MZR, the mass dependence of the specific SN Ia rate
at different redshifts could empirically distinguish between~$\gamma = 0$ and
$\gamma = -0.5$.
To investigate this possibility, we simply evaluate equation~\refp{iarates:eq:specia}
over the appropriate range of lookback times assuming standard cosmological
parameters~\citep{PlanckCollaboration2014}.
For the~$\gamma = 0$ case, we also show the effect of applying an additional
$(\mstar / 10^{10}~\msun)^{-0.15}$.
This prefactor brings the~$\gamma = 0$ predictions into better agreement with
the empirical~$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia} / \mstar \sim \mstar^{-0.3}$ scaling
at~$z = 0$ and is intended to encapsulate the mass scaling needed for some
other unknown process to sufficiently amplify the SN Ia rate at low stellar
masses if it is instead not due to metallicity effects.
\par
We show the resulting specific SN Ia rates as a function of stellar mass at
$z = 0$,~$0.5$ and~$1$ in Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:specia_zdep}.
In both the~$\gamma = 0$ and $\gamma = -0.5$ cases, the scaling of the specific
SN Ia rate with galaxy stellar mass becomes shallower with increasing redshift.
If~$\gamma = -0.5$, these calculations suggest that it should decrease by a
factor of~$\sim$2 between~$z = 0$ and~$z = 1$ at~$\mstar \approx
10^{7.2}~\msun$, the lowest stellar mass for which we have made predictions at
all three redshifts.
If~$\gamma = 0$, then the rate instead decreases by a factor of~$\sim$3 at
$\sim 10^{7.2}~\msun$.
This difference arises because the metallicities of dwarf galaxies decrease
with increasing redshift and~$\gamma = -0.5$ allows them to sustain higher
SN Ia rates than if~$\gamma = 0$.
Empirically, the cosmic SN Ia rate increases with redshift
\citep[e.g.][]{Graur2014}, and we have verified that our framework reproduces
this result by integrating over the SMF (similar to equation
\ref{iarates:eq:hostmassdist} below).
Given this result and the lower stellar masses of the host galaxies at high
redshift, one might expect the trend to steepen with increasing~$z$.
The slope instead decreases here because the lines in Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:specia_zdep}
(right panel) are moving to the right with time as galaxies grow in mass, and
we normalize to unity at a stellar mass of~$10^{10}~\msun$ at all redshifts.

While empirical measurements of the specific SN Ia rate as a function of
stellar mass depend on the assumed SMF~\citep{Gandhi2022}, the host galaxy
mass distribution of observed events does not, making it a potentially more
observationally feasible diagnostic.
As noted in Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:specia_metdep}, only dwarf galaxies are
significantly affected by a metallicity-dependent scaling of SN Ia rates due to
the shape of the MZR, so a~$\gamma \approx -0.5$ scaling should appear as an
enhanced SN Ia rate at the low-mass end of the distribution.
Although this empirical measurement does not depend on the SMF, our theoretical
prediction does because we must take into account the relative abundances of
galaxies of different stellar masses.
The observed rate in a bin of stellar mass can be expressed as the product
of the characteristic rate~$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia}$ at a given stellar mass
and the integral of the SMF~$\Phi(\mstar)$ over the bin in stellar mass,
\begin{equation}
\dot{N}_\text{Ia,cosmic}(M_\star | \gamma) = \dot{N}_\text{Ia}(M_\star | \gamma)
\int_{M_\star}^{M_\star + dM_\star} \Phi(M_\star) dM_\star,
\label{iarates:eq:hostmassdist}
\end{equation}
where~$\dot{\text{N}}_\text{Ia}$ is the numerator of equation~\refp{iarates:eq:specia}.
We show this distribution in Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:hostmassdist} for each combination
of~$\gamma = 0$ and~$-0.5$ and the~\citet{Bell2003} and~\citet{Baldry2012} SMFs,
normalizing to a maximum value of unity.
For untargeted surveys like ASAS-SN, equation~\refp{iarates:eq:hostmassdist} should
describe the observed host galaxy stellar mass distribution exactly, whereas
targeted surveys like the Lick Observatory SN Search~\citep[LOSS;][]{Li2000,
Filippenko2001} would need to correct for their target galaxy selection
criteria.
\par
Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:hostmassdist} shows that galaxies with stellar masses of
$\mstar = 10^{10} - 10^{11}~\msun$ should dominate the SN Ia rate for all
choices of the SMF and~$\gamma$.
This peak rate simply represents the galaxies that dominate the stellar mass.
For a given choice of the SMF, $\gamma = -0.5$ increases the number of SNe Ia
at~$\mstar \approx 10^{7.2}~\msun$ by a factor of~$\sim$3 relative to
$\gamma = 0$.
However, Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:hostmassdist} also shows that the enhancement is small
compared to the differences between the two SMFs.
Between the peak and~$10^{7.2}~\msun$, the ~\citet{Bell2003} host mass
distribution drops by~$\sim$2.5 orders of magnitude while
that of~\citet{Baldry2012} drops by~$\sim$1.5 orders of magnitude.
Fig.~\ref{iarates:fig:hostmassdist} illustrates the need for precise knowledge of the
SMF to accurately determine the metallicity-dependence of SN Ia rates.
