% OSU Thesis and Dissertation LaTeX File
%
% Master file: master.tex
%
% This is the file that links all of the parts of the MS thesis or
% PhD dissertation together and invokes the OSU official document
% style.
%
% The OSU Astronomy Department has modified the Graduate School's
% LaTeX templates to allow use of AASTeX-style markup, making for
% easy conversion of journal papers into the proper dissertation style.
% It also provides access to the AASTeX table formats, so that you 
% don't have to retype all of your tables (this is a good thing).
%
% It also fixes some bugs in the Graduate School's style files.  These
% could be real bugs or could simply be a different reference version
% of TeX, we're not sure.
%
% Based on modifications made by Andrew Stephens and Rick Pogge.
%
% Annotations below describe how to use this.  There are some examples
% of the various pages in this directory, see especially:
%
%	title_srh.tex   - title page template for the Senior Honors thesis
%	title_ms.tex    - title page template for the MS thesis
%	title_phd.tex   - title page template for the PhD dissertation
%	abstract.tex    - abstract template
%	dedication.tex  - dedication template
%	acknowledge.tex - acknowledgements template
%	vita.tex        - Vita template
%       biblio.tex      - Bibliography template
%
% To process, type
%
%    latex master.tex
% 
% repeating this until all warnings about references and cross-references
% are resolved (usually 3-4 times).
%
% To process the dissertation text for conversion to PDF (using either
% Adobe Distiller or ps2pdf):
%
%    dvips -t letter -Ppdf -o master.ps master.dvi
%
% The Graduate School requires that all dissertations and theses produced
% after Autumn Quarter 2002 be submitted electronically as PDF files.
%
% The ``dotex'' script has been provided to handle all of the basic
% dirty work of processing the .tex file into .ps
%	
% Modification History: 
%   2002 January 1 - hooks for thesis (MS) and dissertation (PhD) following
%                    the 2001/2002 Graduate School Handbook [rwp]
%   2002 May 28 - hooks for pdf conversion and bookmarks following the
%                 new Graduate School e-submission requirements [rwp]
%
%   2004 Jun 18 - Of course some of the rules changed, this tries to
%                 accommodate them.  Who thinks these things up? [rwp]
%
%   2013 May 14 - Been a while, but some rules changed again, mostly minor
%                 but pay particular attention to the order of chapters,
%                 bibliography, and appendices. [rwp]
%
%   2014 Jul 9  - Routine check against graduate school rules, and
%                 additions to documentclass options (oneside, hidelinks)
%                 to address issues for electronic dissertations [rwp]
%
%   2016 May 30 - Added the amsmath and tocloft packages. The latter allows
%                 printing the LoF and LoT with the words "Figure" or "Table"
%                 before each number, respetively. [rwp]

%
% If you take it upon yourself to change the order, *bad* things *WILL* 
% happen.  Wicked bad spooky voodoo kinds of things.  Trust us...
%

% The documentclass options in [] setup formatting parameters that
% address grad school and electronic dissertation formatting requirements.
% 
%    12pt = body text base font size is 12pt
%    fleqn = left side alignment of displayed math equations
%    oneside = avoids rogue blank pages that sometimes get created
%              between parts or chapters because book default is 2-sided
%    hidelinks = removes the ugly "blue boxes" around active hyperlinks

% The Bibliography
%
% The dissertation/thesis style requires a global bibliography - you
% cannot have a bibliography chapter-by-chapter.  This is the main

%
% The bibliography comes immediately after the last chapter but
% *BEFORE* the first of any appendices.  See the 00README file
% for how to format appendices if you use them.
