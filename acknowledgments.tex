% Where do I even begin?
My gratitude for the support I have received along the journey to this
dissertation is simply too big for words.
I will try nonetheless.
\par
I will start by thanking the Ohio State Department of Astronomy for providing
me with the opportunity of a lifetime.
A number of my colleagues and mentors have described this department as
``greater than the sum of its parts.''
I can think of no better single-phrase explanation, though it takes the
privilege of existing in this environment to understand just how truly special
it is.
There must be some kind of magic behind how one group of people can be so
scientifically empowering and simultaneously so personally welcoming.
\par
I would especially like to thank my dissertation advisor, David Weinberg, for
being everything I could have hoped for in a mentor and somehow more.
Aside from the unfathomable amount of scientific and professional instruction
you have provided me with, I learned what qualities a fantastic mentor has by
experiencing it firsthand.
I would also like to thank Jennifer Johnson and Christopher Kochanek, first
and foremost for being wonderful advisors who I am honored to have worked with.
