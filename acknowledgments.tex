% The acknowledgments section follows the dedication.  Can be as long or
% short as you wish (``Brevity is the soul of wit''), but generally should
% be a brief, sincere, and professional acknowledgement of everyone who
% played a role in your dissertation (advisor, faculty, fellow students,
% observatory support, etc.).  Funding agencies and fellowships should
% be acknowledged as well.
